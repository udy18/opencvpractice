# OpenCV Practice Code

I have done the following code for practice with OpenCV:

1. **captured**: A WMV file
2. **colortractbar**: A Python source file
3. **kerasocrr**: A Python file source file
4. **matplotlibopencv**: A Python source file
5. **morphological**: A Python source file
6. **objhsv**: A Python source file
7. **opencv geometric shapes**: A Python source file
8. **opencv proj1(capture live stream)**: A Python source file
9. **opencv settingcamera parameters**: A Python source file
10. **opencvbitwiseoperations**: A Python source file
11. **opencvmouseevents**: A Python source file
12. **opencvspiltmerge and other methods**: A Python source file
13. **point**: A Python source file
14. **py_HLTRGB_3_Overlay.ply**: A PLY file
15. **sm**: A Python source file
16. **thresholdingimg**: A Python source file

This code covers a variety of OpenCV-related topics, including image capture, color manipulation, geometric shapes, live streaming, camera parameter settings, bitwise operations, mouse events, and image processing techniques. These practice files will help me improve my understanding and skills in computer vision and image processing using the OpenCV library.
